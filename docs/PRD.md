# **Product Requirements Document (PRD)**  
**Project Name:** Ansible Test Framework for Pytest  
**Author:** Boehringer Ingelheim  
**Date:** May 29, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## **1. Purpose**

The purpose of this project is to develop a Python-based test framework that integrates with `pytest` to facilitate the testing of Ansible playbooks. This framework will address limitations in existing tools by enabling module mocking, scenario-based testing, and result verification in a declarative and extensible manner.

---

## **2. Scope**

This framework will:
- Be installable as a Python package via `pip`.
- Allow execution of Ansible playbooks using `ansible-runner`.
- Enable mocking of Ansible modules and external services (e.g., SMTP).
- Support declarative test scenarios.
- Use a custom callback plugin to collect execution data.
- Provide verifiers to assert expected outcomes.
- Be configurable and extensible by users.

---

## **3. Features**

### 3.1 Playbook Execution
- Use `ansible-runner` to execute playbooks.
- Support passing inventory, variables, and other runtime parameters.

### 3.2 Module Mocking
- Replace specific Ansible modules with user-defined mocks.
- Provide a mocking interface for common modules.

### 3.3 External Service Mocking
- Built-in support for mocking services like:
  - SMTP servers
  - HTTP endpoints
  - SSH servers (optional)

### 3.4 Declarative Scenarios
- Define test scenarios in YAML or JSON.
- Include:
  - Playbook path
  - Mock definitions
  - Expected outcomes

### 3.5 Callback Plugin
- Custom callback plugin to collect:
  - Task results
  - Execution logs
  - Module invocations

### 3.6 Verifiers
- Compare actual results with expected outcomes.
- Support:
  - Output matching
  - State validation
  - Log inspection

### 3.7 Pytest Integration
- Provide fixtures and hooks for seamless integration with `pytest`.
- Allow test discovery and reporting via `pytest`.

---

## **4. User Stories**

### As a developer:
- I want to mock Ansible modules so I can test playbooks without affecting real systems.
- I want to define test scenarios declaratively so I can reuse and share them.
- I want to verify playbook results automatically so I can ensure correctness.

---

## **5. Technical Requirements**

- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Dependencies:**
  - `ansible-runner`
  - `pytest`
  - `PyYAML`
  - `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock`
- **Packaging:** `setuptools` or `poetry`
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins

---

## **6. Out of Scope**

- Testing Ansible roles in isolation (unless part of a playbook).
- Real-time infrastructure provisioning.
- GUI or web interface.


---

## **7. Risks and Mitigations**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Compatibility with different Ansible versions | Use `ansible-runner` abstraction and test across versions |
| Complexity of mocking modules | Provide default mocks and clear interfaces |
| Declarative format ambiguity | Use schema validation and examples |
